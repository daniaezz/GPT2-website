# GPT2-website
website created by feeding(?) gpt2 my commlab projects 

this website is not the best

i gave gpt2 a text document containtaining the html and css for my past communications lab projects.

i generated the html document by giving it the starting word as "<html>" 
  

then i genereated the css document seperatly using .container{ as the start. .container{ was chosen as the starting word because it was the recurring div in the genereated html document. 
  
  
for the css document, i commented out two lines that hid the content of the webpage. 
  
  
for the html document i added a link to the css document.

  everything else was completely generated by gpt2 on colab for software art - text spring 2022.
